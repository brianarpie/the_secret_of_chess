# TODO: create a controller that keeps track of whose turn it is, messages chessboard.rb
# and pieces.rb to only allow legal moves... perhaps legal moves will be something we can
# store in the data structures of the pieces themselves. Also, update the view.
# this project will be implemented with a Model-View-Controller architecture in mind.
